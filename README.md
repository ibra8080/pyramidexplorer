## UX

I drew a quick sketch of the site's layout and pages

and then used Figma to create a Wireframe, making sure it was responsive

### Colour Scheme

I used a color scheme derived from the colors of the clear sky in Cairo with the colors of the desert and the pyramids. 

- `#3a3a3a` used for primary text.
- `#3462BF` used for primary highlights.
- `#3a3a3a` used for secondary text.
- `#D9984A` used for secondary highlights.

I used [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/search?q=pyramids%20) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography


- [Inter-Black-Bold](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Inter-Light-Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
